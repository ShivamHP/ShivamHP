### Hey there!

I am Shivam Pachchigar, currently focusing a lot on developing great software while pursuing my bachelors in Electrical and Electronics at BITS Goa. I have been working on developing apps with Flutter for the last 2 years, with industry-experience of 9+ months. I also have experience working on native Android applications, and this experience is what helped me embrace Flutter so much. I am also writing some server-side code nowadays. Also, occasionally I try to write some smart-contracts, yes, I am passionate about Web3.

<summary>Early Professional career</summary>

There is quite a narrow gap between my student life and start of my career to be honest. As a college freshman, I was just playing around with Flutter exploring what the framework can do. Then someday, through a common friend, came to know about two seniors who were working on their startup called [Cryptocase](https://github.com/Cryptocasehq). They invited me to work on their mobile app as an intern, an offer I cannot decline, since anyway, I wasn't doing anything meaningful at that time. We spent a great time together, and when I entered my sophomore year in college, they asked me out if I would be interested to be a founding team member and try to lead the other developers on the project, which was also something I cannot decline :) But after about 2-3 months getting this opportunity, I thought deeply about all this and realized that I was just getting promoted to better positions and given more responsibilities, but due to this, I was not able to spend much time on learning new things (As a college student, I just want to focus on upkilling myself). Quite confident about my skills and the impact I created, I left Cryptocase. And as of now, I am working on a project, where I will get to learn a lot of new things, again as just a developer and not a founding team member anymore, and I also strongly believe that this new project can actually change lives of many people and would also upskill me a lot.

<summary>What I would like to do</summary>

As of now, I just want to learn all the new things that come in my way. I am already quite confident about my app development skills, working on developing the same confidence writing server-side code. Apart from this, I also like a lot to learn about Web3 and how to make a successful startup.  
  
Although, there is not quite a definite thing which I want to do in future, I want to create great softwares that can positively impact lives of people. And in the process, get myself a bit more money. It doesn't matter if I am leading a project or working under someone's leadership, I am just hungry for experience and knowledge.
